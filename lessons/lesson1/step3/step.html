<h3>More Operations on Strings</h3>

<p>There are many operations available on strings, so let's see some simple examples:</p>
<p><code>String.lowercase "MARY"</code></p>

<br />
<p>Here's a more practical example, generating a filename from components: </p>
<p><code>String.concat "/" [""; "usr"; "local"; "bin"]</code></p>
<p>The second argument is a list of strings.  Lists will be covered more later.</p>


<br />
<p>It is sometimes useful to extract an integer from a string. This is
easy in OCaml:</p>
<p><code>int_of_string "546"</code></p>
