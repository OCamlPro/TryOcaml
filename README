=== Overview ===
TryOCaml is the easiest way to learn how to code in OCaml language. A funny way
to learn the language.
TryOCaml is based on (http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/files/toplevel/index.html) built
with js_of_ocaml (see http://ocsigen.org/lwt/).

=== Requirements ===

  * Findlib
  * Lwt (version 2.3.0** at least, see http://ocsigen.org/lwt/)

=== Try it ===

0: make

Then, with your favorite browser launch tryocaml/index.html:

1: chromium-browser tryocaml/index.html

=== Submit your lessons ===

To add new lessons:
 0: cd $TRYOCAML_PATH/lessons
 1: mkdir -p lessonX   ##where X is a lesson number
 2: cp -r lesson1/step1 lessonX/stepY ## where Y is a step number
 3: edit lessonX/stepY/step.html with the text of your lesson/step
 4: edit lessonX/stepY/step.ml  with the code to check the input and output entered by the user
     (tryocaml will move to the next step only if the function returns true)

 5: touch lessons.txt ## NEEDED to trigger a rebuild after each modification
 6: make

The file stepY.txt has to contain the tutorial message, whereas stepY.ml has
to contain a test function.
