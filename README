TryOCaml is the easiest way to learn how to code in OCaml language. A funny way
to learn the language.
TryOCaml is based on (http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/files/toplevel/index.html) built 
with js_of_ocaml (see http://ocsigen.org/lwt/).

=== Requirements ===

  * Findlib
  * Lwt (version 2.3.0** at least, see http://ocsigen.org/lwt/)

Then, with your favorite browser launch tryocaml/index.html:

1: chromium-browser tryocaml/index.html
